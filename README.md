**bloc_demo:** Advanced Flutter Bloc State Management

Welcome to bloc_demo, a comprehensive Flutter project showcasing advanced state management with the Bloc and Cubit patterns. This repository is designed to help you understand and implement robust state management techniques, clean architecture, and best practices in Flutter development.



**About**

This repository is a practical guide to state management in Flutter using Bloc, Cubit, and Hydrated Bloc for persistence. The app follows a feature-first architecture, with clean and scalable code that is easy to maintain and extend. You'll also find examples of GoRouter for routing, GetIt for dependency injection, and Dio for API calls.

Features

**Feature-first Architecture:** A clean and scalable project structure, where each feature is contained within its own folder.
Bloc & Cubit Implementation: Detailed implementation of Bloc and Cubit to manage application state.
Hydrated Bloc: Enables state persistence so that app data can be saved and restored between sessions.
GoRouter: Easy-to-use routing package for clean and declarative routing.
GetIt: A lightweight dependency injection package for managing app dependencies.
Dart Extensions: For simplifying code and enhancing readability.
Dio: A powerful HTTP client for making API calls.
Comprehensive Testing: Extensive tests covering Bloc, state management, and widgets to ensure app reliability.
Technologies Used

Flutter: The UI framework for building natively compiled applications.
Bloc: A state management pattern for handling application state and events in a predictable manner.
Cubit: A simplified version of Bloc for managing state without dealing with events.
Hydrated Bloc: Extends Bloc with automatic state persistence.
GoRouter: A flexible and declarative routing package.
GetIt: A service locator and dependency injection framework.
Dio: A network library for making HTTP requests.
Dart Extensions: Extend the functionality of existing classes.
Flutter Testing: For unit, widget, and integration testing.
